# Wordpress-Theme-and-Website

This a University project that I completed as a group in my final year of studies.

##Overview
We were to improve a static basic website into a dynamic website and theme. The theme is also stand alone so any dev team could use it.

I will link out github repository as it's the easiest way to maintain commit history so please go check it out (bspalding23 is my Uni account):
