This a University project that I completed as a group in my final year of studies.

## Overview
We were to improve a static basic website into a dynamic website and theme. The theme is also stand alone so any dev team could use it.

The github repository is linked above as it's the easiest way to maintain commit history so please go check it out (bspalding23 is my Uni account)

Below is also a video presentation about our project with a demo at the end of the final product (Sorry for audio quality but had to compressed video):
